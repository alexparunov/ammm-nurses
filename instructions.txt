Parameters:

parameters.py contain 25 parameters of problem. In other words, different constraint parameters and difference instance sizes.
All of them have a feasible solution by OPL.


GRASP:

In order to run GRASP script, just execute "grasp.py" and specify the index of parameters.
For example "grasp.py 3" command will solve a problem specified in parameters.py as param4.
This script is written in Python3, so make sure you have it installed before running.


BRKGA:

In order to run BRKGA script, similarly to GRASP, just execute "main.py" script located in BRKGA directory and specify the index of parameters.
For example "main.py 3" command will solve a problem specified in parameters.py as param4.
Make sure to run the script from BRKGA directory, otherwise it won't work.

OS Preference is Linux.
